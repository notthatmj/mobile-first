# Sniffin' Sticks app

This is an exploratory app to create a mobile-first
app for application of field tests for researchers.

Some of the things of interest:

 * how much useful logic can be put into a single-page app thus allowing disconnected function;
 * what are the data limits (size, and otherwise, e.g. off-line validation);
 * how can  a single page app be deployed to disconnectecd mobiles (e.g. iOS, Android, WinMobile);

Initially, the *Recipe Book AngularDart application* from the
[angular-dart-tutorial's](https://angulardart.org/tutorial) recipe book example was the starting point.
